The aim of this project was to build a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to identify our position on a map using the position resection method.
Position resection is a method for determining an unknown geographic position by measuring bearing angles with respect to known positions. Therefore, a point with unknown position is occupied and sightings are taken for three known points.
